# Example App

Note: This is an example react-native app structure as a starting point.

## Run App

To the run app perform the following:
1. Install dependencies
```
yarn
```

2. Install Cocopods
```
cd ios
pod install
```

3. Run iOS/Android

```
yarn ios
```

```
yarn android
```

## Testing
I've only written a couple of tests as a base but a lot more need to be written to across the codebase, including sagas, etc.

```
yarn test
```
